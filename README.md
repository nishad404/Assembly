                                      This is the assembly language and register 
                                  
  N.B[Before run the code you should remind the input value,not greater than 9]
  
To known about assembly language first you need to know Register.How many type and their function.
REGISTER:::::::Registers are essentially places that the processor can store memory. You can think of them as buckets which the processor can store information in

                            The EQU Directive
                            
                            
                            
The EQU directive is used for defining constants. The syntax of the EQU directive is as follows âˆ’

CONSTANT_NAME EQU expression;


TOTAL_STUDENTS equ 50;
SYS_WRITE equ 4
                            
                                                 PROLOGUE AND EPILOGUE
Then the prologue is executed:    
push  ebp         ; Save the stack-frame base pointer (of the calling function).

mov   ebp, esp    ; Set the stack-frame base pointer to be the current

                  ; location on the stack.
                  
sub   esp, N      ; Grow the stack by N bytes to reserve space for local variables



The epilog:
mov   esp, ebp    ; Put the stack pointer back where it was when this function

                  ; was called.
                  
pop   ebp         ; Restore the calling function's stack frame.

ret               ; Return to the calling function.
